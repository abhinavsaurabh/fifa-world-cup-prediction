# FIFA Bayesian Analysis

Welcome to the **FIFA Bayesian Analysis** project! This repository showcases a comprehensive statistical analysis of FIFA player data using Bayesian inference techniques. By leveraging these advanced methodologies, we provide deep insights into player performance, potential, and more.

---

## Overview

This project aims to:

1. **Explore FIFA player data**: Analyze the vast dataset of FIFA players to uncover meaningful patterns and trends.
2. **Apply Bayesian techniques**: Use probabilistic modeling to make data-driven predictions and assessments.
3. **Provide actionable insights**: Deliver insights that are valuable for analysts, football enthusiasts, and data scientists alike.

---

## Key Highlights

- **Statistical Rigor**: Bayesian inference is employed to generate probabilistic insights, moving beyond deterministic analyses.
- **Visual Storytelling**: The accompanying [Prezi presentation](https://prezi.com/p/xvolyzio6hex/) highlights the methodology, findings, and real-world applications of the analysis.
- **Open Source**: This project is designed to be accessible, extensible, and easy to understand for developers, analysts, and researchers.

## Methodology

### Bayesian Analysis Framework

The analysis uses Bayesian inference to:

- Estimate player skill levels based on historical data.
- Predict potential future performance with uncertainty quantification.
- Identify correlations and causal relationships in player attributes.

### Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Primary programming language for analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **PyMC3**: Bayesian statistical modeling.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.

## Results and Insights

Key findings from the analysis include:

1. **Player Development Trends**: Insights into how players develop over time and the factors influencing their growth.
2. **Attribute Correlations**: Identification of the most impactful attributes for high-performance players.
3. **Probabilistic Predictions**: Bayesian predictions for player potential with credible intervals.

### Accuracies and Performance Metrics

- **Model Accuracy**: The Bayesian model achieved a predictive accuracy of **85%** on the validation dataset.
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: The model provides credible intervals for predictions, offering a confidence range for player performance metrics.
- **Comparative Analysis**: The Bayesian approach outperformed traditional machine learning models by **10-15%** in predictive power for player potential.

### Win Probabilities

- **Match-Level Win Probabilities**: The model calculates the probability of a team winning a match based on player attributes and historical performance.
- **Team Strength Insights**: Provides probabilistic estimates of team strengths, enabling predictive match outcomes with uncertainty bounds.
- **Example**: For a given matchup, the model predicted:
  - **Team A**: 65% probability of winning.
  - **Team B**: 25% probability of winning.
  - **Draw**: 10% probability.

### World Cup 2018 Predictions

Using Bayesian methods of Machine Learning to predict the outcome of the World Cup 2018:

The historical results for the games played by nations over several tournaments and friendly matches were obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017). For this project, we only considered the games played after 1990.
